# Network Traffic Classification

The use of machine learning to classify network traffic.

The dataset used in project was downloaded from Kaggle platform (https://www.kaggle.com/jsrojas/ip-network-traffic-flows-labeled-with-87-apps).

File Data-Preparing.ipynb implements the preparation of data for use in RandomForest algorithm.

In ANN and RandomForest there are application of algorithms to classify network traffic.

RandomForest algorithm was used on preprocessed CSV file created in the previous step and ANN was used on the initial file downloaded from Kaggle.
